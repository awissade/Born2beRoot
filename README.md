The "Born2beRoot" project 🌐🔐 is your gateway to mastering virtualization and system administration. It requires setting up a server 🖥️ following stringent guidelines, without a graphical interface, to understand the essence of minimal services. You'll choose between Debian or Rocky for your OS, focusing on security by enforcing SELinux or AppArmor, configuring SSH on a specific port without root access, and ensuring a firewall is active 🛡️. The project demands creating encrypted partitions using LVM, implementing a strong password policy, and meticulous sudo configuration. A unique addition is developing a bash script, `monitoring.sh`, to display system stats 📊 at startup. This endeavor sharpens your skills in operating system internals, security practices, and scripting, preparing you for complex system administration tasks.
